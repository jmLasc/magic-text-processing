CSCI2349 Semester Project: Group 9

This project analyzes the properties of *Magic: The Gathering* Cards. Data was obtained from [Scryfall](https://scryfall.com/docs/api/bulk-data). 

In order to properly use the dataset, download "Oracle Cards" from the above hyperlink and drop it in the project folder. Rename this data file to "cards.json" in order to work with the code. It is too large to upload to github.
